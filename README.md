**Hello guys!**  

This repo is where I store my experiments, serious projects, or just random ideas to test things out.  
**Use it if you want, understand it if you can, complain? Just leave.**  

## Features  
- **Efficient:** Built with brains, not half-hearted effort. If it can be fast, why make it complicated?  
- **Straight to the Point:** No unnecessary fluff. Every line of code has a purpose.  
- **Logical:** Every function exists for a reason—unlike some people who write code just to look cool.  

## How to Use  
1. Clone this repo. If you don’t know how, **Google exists for a reason.**  
2. Understand the logic. **Don’t copy-paste if you don’t get it.**  
3. Run it as needed. If it doesn’t work, read the code again.  

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Khaymat/[repo-name].git
```
